### Doing a release

After finishing your feature normally, to automatically bump version number, update changelog and do an npm release:

1.  `npm run add-change`
2.  Follow the instructions
3.  Commit the changeset file(s) to your feature branch and push to Github
4.  Create a PR normally, including the changeset file(s)
5.  Eventually accept the PR called "Version Packages" created by the changeset bot
